jMudServer, by Humera

To run:
1) Copy ChatServer.jar to a directory
2) Create a directory named 'log' at the same level as the Jar file
3) Use the command 'java -jar ChatServer.jar -p <port>' to launch the server
4) Connect via chat!

Note:
The server will create a file called accounts.xml in the same directory as the Jar.
If this file does not exist, the first person to connect will authenticate as a
Super Admin.
